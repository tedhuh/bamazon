Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Give examples

Open up the terminal and run NODE bamazon. 
After you run the node file, there should be a file a table that explains all of the products and their identification. 
The app should then prompt users with two messages.
The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.



Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app should log a phrase like Insufficient quantity! and then prevent the order from going through.
